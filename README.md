Notary Chains
=============

Overview
--------

The NotaryChains project seeks to leverage the block chain technology behind cryptocurrencies to solve the more general problem of creating a distributed system of record over multiple unrelated computer systems.  This is done by using the Bitcoin block chain to secure a ledger of time stamped hashes of digital artifacts.  In this way NotaryChains constructs a simple, standard, effective, and secure foundation for Bitcoin 2.0 style applications.  

Many projects use Bitcoin as a mechanism for creating a "Proof of Existence" for digital artifacts.  The NotaryChains project extends this idea to provide a "Proof of Process."  Proof of each step in a process can be entered into a "notary chain" of provable events.  One obvious sort of notary chain is a log.  A security camera can log a stream of signatures, proving video was taken at a point in time, and that the video has not be altered.  A "cryptocurrency coin" is also a process, one proving that coins existed and were exchanged.  The the steps in processing a title for Real Estate is a process, and one where the documentation can prove decisive in court.  

Notary Chains are constructed from entries crafted to support a wide range of applications.  An entry can be used to prove data existed at a point in time.  And other notary chains and demonstrate their reaction to such data.  In other words, a notary chain is a sequence of entries that define some progression of state, and the data that drove that progression.  Each notary chain has its own rules, and entries in these chains are constrained by those rules.  

The architecture for NotaryChains allows for the easy construction of tokens or coins, securities, smart contracts, etc.
