Factom
=============

Overview
--------

Factom is a extension to the Bitcoin Blockchain that solves the three core problems of all Bitcon 2.0 applications: Speed, Cost, and Bloat.

The Bitcoin Blockchain provides an opportunity to create a trustless, perminant system of record secured by 10,000+ nodes across the world. Factom is a simple way to extend this technology. Instead of writing every transaction directly to the blockchain, Factom allows you to write hundreds transactions to Factom Chains on a federated server pool. These blocks are then converted to a single hash every 10 minutes and stored in the Bitcoin Blockchain. This allows applications to write transactions faster, at 1/100th of the cost, and prevent the Blockchain from bloating. 

At the most basic level, Factom provides "Proof of Existence."  Any digital artifact can be reduced to a signature that proves its existence at a point in time. Factom extends this idea.  Each Factom subsystem in the group provides a "Proof of Process."  Proof of each step in a process can be entered into a "Factom chain" of provable events.  One obvious sort of Factom chain is a log.  A security camera can log a stream of signatures, proving video was taken at a point in time, and that the video has not be altered.  A Coin is also a process, one proving that coins existed and were exchanged.  The steps in processing a title for Real Estate is a process, and one where the documentation can prove decisive in court.  

Factom Chains are constructed from entries crafted to support a wide range of applications.  An entry can be used to prove data existed at a point in time.  And other Factom Chains and demonstrate their reaction to such data.  In other words, a Factom chain is a sequence of entries that define some progression of state, and the data that drove that progression.  Each Factom chain has its own rules, and entries in these Chains are constrained by those rules.  

The architecture for Factom allows for the easy construction of tokens or coins, securities, smart contracts, etc.
